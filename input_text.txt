A natural disaster is the highly harmful impact on a society or community following a natural hazard event. Examples of natural hazard events include floods, droughts, earthquakes, tropical cyclones, volcanic activity, wildfires.[1] A natural disaster can cause loss of life or damage property, and typically leaves economic damage in its wake. The severity of the damage depends on the population's disaster preparedness and on the existing infrastructure.[2] Scholars have been saying that the term natural disaster is unsuitable and should be abandoned.[3] Instead, the simpler term disaster could be used, while also specifying the category (or type) of hazard.[4][5][6] A disaster is a result of a natural or human-made hazard impacting a vulnerable community. It is the combination of the hazard along with exposure of a vulnerable society that results in a disaster.

In modern times, the line between natural and human-made disasters is difficult to draw.[3][7][8] In fact, the term natural disaster was called a misnomer already in 1976.[6] Human choices around for example architecture,[9] fire risk,[10][11] and resource management[12] potentially play a role in causing or worsening natural disasters. Climate change also has an impact on the frequency of those disasters that are caused by extreme weather hazards (or "climate hazards"), such as floods, heatwaves, wildfires and tropical cyclones.[13]

Natural disasters can be worsened for example by inadequate building norms, marginalization of people and poor choices on land use planning.[3] Many developing countries lack effective disaster risk reduction systems.[14] This makes them more vulnerable to natural disasters than high income countries. An adverse event will only rise to the level of a disaster if it occurs in an area with a vulnerable population.[15][16]
Terminology
A natural disaster is the highly harmful impact on a society or community following a natural hazard event. The term "disaster" itself is defined as follows: "Disasters are serious disruptions to the functioning of a community that exceed its capacity to cope using its own resources. Disasters can be caused by natural, man-made and technological hazards, as well as various factors that influence the exposure and vulnerability of a community."[17]

The US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) explains the relationship between natural disasters and natural hazards as follows: "Natural hazards and natural disasters are related but are not the same. A natural hazard is the threat of an event that will likely have a negative impact. A natural disaster is the negative impact following an actual occurrence of natural hazard in the event that it significantly harms a community.[1] An example of the distinction between a natural hazard and a disaster is that an earthquake is the hazard which caused the 1906 San Francisco earthquake disaster.

A natural hazard[18] is a natural phenomenon that might have a negative effect on humans and other animals, or the environment. Natural hazard events can be classified into two broad categories: geophysical and biological.[19] Natural hazards can be provoked or affected by anthropogenic processes, e.g. land-use change, drainage and construction.[20]

There are 18 natural hazards included in the National Risk Index of FEMA: avalanche, coastal flooding, cold wave, drought, earthquake, hail, heat wave, tropical cyclone, ice storm, landslide, lightning, riverine flooding, strong wind, tornado, tsunami, volcanic activity, wildfire, winter weather.[1] In addition there are also tornados and dust storms.
